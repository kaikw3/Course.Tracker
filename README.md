# Course Tracker 

## CPSC 210 Project


**What will this application do and who will use it?**

- This application is a course tracker which allows the user to keep track 
of their courses that they have taken. The user can input details of a 
course, such as how many credits the course is worth or the course code, 
among others, and add it to a list of courses that they have taken. 
The user will also be able to keep track of other details, such as 
the grade they received in the course. This application will mainly 
be used by university students, but could also be used by high school 
students or any other student looking to keep track of the courses they have taken.

**Why does this project interest *ME?***

- This project interests me as going into my third year, I have realized the
importance of keeping track of your courses taken. As a Business and Computer 
Science student, keeping track of what courses I have completed is crucial 
to knowing what courses I still need to take. Tracking also helps ensure 
that you have taken your program course requirements and fulfilled your 
certain faculty requirements. Overall, neatly seeing the courses you have 
taken allows for better organization of future courses and ensures that you 
maximize your degree.
